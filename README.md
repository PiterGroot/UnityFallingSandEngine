"# Unity Falling Sand Engine" 

### You can play it [here](https://pitergroot.itch.io/falling-sand-engine)

#### A falling sand game I originally wrote for a game jam, but decided to work on it alone instead. The performance could be better, but this game is still in development and it's just a fun little side project at the moment.

You can place 7 different element at your mouse position. All with unique properties and interactions.
