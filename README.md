"# Unity Falling Sand Engine" 
#### Disclaimer: I'm working on a brand-new falling sand sim in c++ using Raylib [here](https://github.com/PiterGroot/SandStorm)


### You can play it [here](https://pitergroot.itch.io/falling-sand-engine)

#### A falling sand game I originally wrote for a game jam, but decided to work on it alone instead. This page hosts the first prototype of this project so be warned, this is still a lot of gamejam code. Currently I'm working on a far better solution utilizing unity DOTS. You can place 7 different element at your mouse position. All with unique properties and interactions.
